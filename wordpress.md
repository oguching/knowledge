Taxonomy  
Think of a Taxonomy as a type of categorizing feature that is completely custom. WordPress already includes Categories and Tag support by default but developers can create custom taxonomies to extend their themes or plugins even further.

Child Themes 
Child themes are the recommended way to customise an existing theme. It inherits the functionality and styling of it's parent theme. Usually the Child theme would contain a `style.css` and a `functions.php` file. WordPress looks to the child theme folder first before the parent theme. You can override the parent theme functionality with these files. You can even have an `index.php` file in your child theme folder and it will override the parent's.
