You may be used to types in other languages: `int`, `string`, `boolean` and so on. 
JavaScript also has types but only values have types, variables do not have type.
So in JavaScript I can do 
```JavaScript 
  var a = 'hello';
  typeof a;  //string
  
  a = 42;
  typeof a;  //Number
```
`a` is just a container and can be assigned any value of any type.

There are 7 types in JavaScript
*  `string`   
* `Number`  
* `Boolean`  
* `null`  
* `undefined`  
* `object`
* `Symbol`
