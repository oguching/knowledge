When choosing fonts there are three things to keep in mind: **readability**, **legibility**, and **purpose**.
Choose fonts that are conventional and easy to read. Avoid highly decorative fonts in favour of simple and practical fonts.
Also be mindful of the purpose of a font. For example, some fonts are more suited for headers rather than body text.

Pairing Fonts. Keep font pairing simple to a maximum of three different fonts. Pair fonts that contrast each other.The next step after
pairing font is setting font sizes. [Modular Scale](http://www.modularscale.com/) by is a great tool for this.
